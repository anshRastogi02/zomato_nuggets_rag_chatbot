# Zomato Nuggets RAG Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project implements a chatbot that utilizes the Gemini model and various APIs to provide information about food items and restaurants. It integrates data scraping from Zomato and processes menu information to generate responses to user queries.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The project scrapes restaurant and menu data from Zomato using the `process_all_menus.py` script. This script extracts relevant information from JSON files and generates text blobs that summarize the menu items.

2. **Embedding Creation**: The chatbot uses the `SentenceTransformer` model to create embeddings for the text blobs. These embeddings are indexed using FAISS, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

3. **User Interaction**: The chatbot interface is built with Streamlit. Users can input their queries about food items, and the chatbot captures this input.

4. **Query Processing**: When a user submits a question, the chatbot encodes the query into an embedding and searches the FAISS index for the most relevant text blobs. It retrieves the top context chunks to provide a basis for generating a response.

5. **Response Generation**: The chatbot constructs a prompt using the retrieved context and the user's question. It then uses the Gemini model to generate a coherent answer based on the provided context.

6. **Display Results**: The generated response is displayed in the Streamlit interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

## Features
- **Chatbot Interface**: Built using Streamlit for user interaction.
- **Data Scraping**: Retrieves restaurant and menu data from Zomato.
- **Text Generation**: Uses the Gemini model for generating responses based on user queries.
- **Embedding and Search**: Implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to answer questions using context from scraped data.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Main application file for the chatbot
â”œâ”€â”€ process_all_menus.py # Script for processing menu JSON files into text blobs
â”œâ”€â”€ location.py # Module for retrieving user location based on IP
â””â”€â”€ restaurant_data/ # Directory for storing scraped restaurant data
â””â”€â”€ menus/ # Directory for storing menu JSON files

```
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `faiss`
  - `torch`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `transformers`
  - `google-generativeai`
  - `streamlit`
  - `requests`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
